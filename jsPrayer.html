        <!-- How to curse someone

            i am afraid to replace the code above and to read through a text file containing this
            
            Our Haskell, who art in binary,
            hallowed be thy type system,
            thy monoids come,
            thy will be done,
            on VSCode as it is in emacs.
            Give us this day our daily recursion,
            and forgive us our side effects and infinite loops,
            and lead us not into imperitive languages,
            but deliver us from mutation,
            for thine is the type-system and the monoids
            and the pure functions, forever.

            Amen

            
        -->
