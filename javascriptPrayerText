Our JavaScript, who art in React,
hallowed be thy libraries,
thy extensions come,
thy will be done,
on VSCode as it is on NotePad++.
Give us this day our daily recursion,
and forgive us our side effects and APIs,
and lead us not into Angular,
but deliver us from complacency,
for thine is the libraries and the extensions
and the libraries, forever.

Amen
